Use a video as a ad
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now the old ads system is replaced by the new `Ads Server
Plugin <https://github.com/DanielnetoDotCom/YouPHPTube/wiki/Ad-Server-Plugin>`__
> **Old versions** > To use a video as a ad, go to My videos ->
Edit-symbol and enable Create an Advertising. > After enabling this, you
can directly set some options, like the name, link and active categorie
for example. > When the video is saved like this, it will show up under
the menu-point Video Advertising, where you can edit the ad-options
