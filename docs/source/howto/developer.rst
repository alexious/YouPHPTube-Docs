Here, you can find all developer-related stuff. 

Code-structure
--------------

Our structure is half-way model view controll (MVC) based.

In the folder **objects**, you can find all models and dynamic json-files.

In the folder **view**, you can find all the view, which are mixed with the control-part.

Do never any changes in **videos/cache** because those files can change rapidly!

Plugins
^^^^^^^

We have a great plugin-system. Following scenarios and more are possible with it:

- Templating as you like (Gallery- and YouPHPFlix-plugin are good examples)
- Extend the videoplayer
- Change the login

Whenever possible, use a plugin since it will be much easier for you to do a update.
