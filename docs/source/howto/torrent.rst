Webtorrents in YPT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Webtorrents are a experimental technologie for us. Anyway, some questions can be answered already.

"Upload" a video
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Because torrent is about decentralisation, everyone can join distribute your content.

For this, there are several trackers you can setup and use. This can be complicated, so i make a very simple tutorial about this.

Go to https://instant.io/ and share a compatible mp4-file there.

For more avaibility, give away the "Share link" to friends. With this, your computer / browser will upload the video - if you turn off as single uploader, no one can see it anymore!

On youphptube, go to **"My videos" -> "Embed a video-link"** and select **"Torrent (MP4-magnet-link)"** there. Take the magnet-link from above and put it into **"Video Link"-textfield**.
