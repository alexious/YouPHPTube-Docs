Install in webspace
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This can be one of the most comfortable solutions for a lot of users, but it has some limitations. **Our encoder and livestream will never work with a webspace only**.

If this is fine for you, just grab the zip at github, unzip and upload it and follow the instructions.

Some hosters provide other php-versions and extensions. Most hosters support all requirements YouPHPTube needs. If you want to be shure everything works fine and fast, get shure that PHP is above version 5.6 and mysqlnd is installed.

We also provide a fallback for mysqlnd. But mysqlnd is important because it's much better tested and contain a cache-mechanism in our implementation.
