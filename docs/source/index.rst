Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

LAMP
^^^^

LAMP means Linux Apache Mysql and PHP. Those manuals are great if you
set it up from scratch.

-  `How to install LAMP, FFMPEG and Git on a fresh Ubuntu 16.x For
   YouPHPTube version 4.x or
   newer <install/installUbuntu16.html>`__
-  `How to install LAMP, FFMPEG and Git on a fresh Ubuntu 18.x for
   YouPHPTube version 4.x or
   newer <install/installUbuntu18.html>`__
-  `Install YouPHPTube in Debian
   9.3 <install/installDebian93.html>`__

Nginx
^^^^^

Nginx is only experimental supported for the moment.

Since we have php-routing enable, this should be possible:

https://github.com/skipperbent/simple-php-router#setting-up-nginx

Thanks to patriclougheed, there are also two config-files for nginx
(this solution surround the php-router above):

-  `Streamer <https://gist.github.com/patriclougheed/706677ffe2459df3b6587e54fd4a0923>`__
-  `Encoder <https://gist.github.com/patriclougheed/29a6d997a1371952e29bd8384ea9bf4e>`__
   (this is needed anyway, until php-router also reaches the encoder)

Both methods should work. You can find it's issue here:
https://github.com/DanielnetoDotCom/YouPHPTube/issues/691

Microsofts IIS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This should work, but it's more a side-effect of implement
simple-php-router than something else (eventualy it will never be
tested?).

The web.config-file is already added, a direct copy-paste of this:

https://github.com/skipperbent/simple-php-router#setting-up-iis

Performance
~~~~~~~~~~~

When you have a lot of users, your server can reach it's limits. To
prevent this, there are some things possible. \* Use a host with mysqlnd
enabled! We provide support for non-mysqlnd-host's, but we have a
SQL-cache for mysqlnd only. Also, this is a fast, native driver (better
performance anyway). If you are unshure if you have this, ask your
hoster. \* Enable minify of javascript! This helps only, to reduce the
bandwidth a little. Go to advanced customization-plugin and enable
"Minify JS". Clear videos/cache after this! \* Enable the
`Cache-Plugin <Cache-Plugin>`__ \* Disable (Gallery- and
Youphpflix-plugin) and not set gifs (use less bandwidth)
